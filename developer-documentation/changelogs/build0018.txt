Web of Trust Version 0.4.4 build0018
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

NOTICE: While this release has not yet been bundled with a new Freenet 
release, it can be acquired a lot easier than previous non-bundled 
ones:
1) Update your Freenet to the testing version using the shell command
   "./update.sh testing" on Linux or "update.cmd testing" on Windows.
2) Unload the "WebOfTrust" plugin and load the "WebOfTrust Testing 
   Versions" plugin. Please do first read the description for the 
   security implications!
Once Freenet build 1471 is released, step 1 will not be necessary 
anymore.
You will also get this release someday if you do not switch to the 
testing  branch. It will just take longer: Non-testing releases are 
shipped together with regular Freenet releases; and Freenet releases do 
not happen as often as WoT releases.

This WoT version finally ships some of the long awaited core performance 
improvements:

- Previous builds would fall back to "full Score re-computation" upon 
  Trust changes which cause "distrust": Removal of a Trust value, 
  changing a Trust value from above zero to zero or negative, or adding 
  a zero or below zero Trust value. The full re-computation was a
  *very* slow piece of code as it basically recalculates the whole 
  Score database. It usually took ~ 1 minute, or even 10 minutes on some 
  machines. This was made even worse by the fact that it happened not 
  only for local Trust changes but also for remote ones. Also, due to 
  unfortunate current limitations of the database code [4], it would 
  block the web interface from responding during the whole time.
  This build ships an incremental Score recomputation algorithm for 
  these situations - which should be a lot faster:
  Measurements [1] show an average execution time of 1.7 seconds = a 
  speed improvement of factor 28.
  As there was an incremental recomputation code for non-distrust Trust 
  changes already, Score recomputation is fully incremental now.

- Restarting of WoT / your computer usually caused:
    1) a defragmentation of the database.
    2) a full Score recomputation (to prevent bugs in the existing 
       incremental Score computation code from causing wrong values to 
       exist for a long time).
  This has been changed to:
    1) Defrag only happens once a week.
    2) Full Score recomputation only happens once a month.
  As a consequence, startup should be a lot faster.
  It now takes ~2 minutes on my machine.

Next steps of development will be:

- While the average execution time of 1.7 seconds of the new incremental 
  Score computation algorithm is acceptable, its worst case execution 
  time of above 60 seconds is not.
  It is difficult to judge how frequently the worst case happens, as the 
  benchmark which was conducted had to be synthetic: The operations 
  which cause the new code to run are quite rare with network dumps, so 
  real Trust changes couldn't be used as a benchmarks.
  It thus can be hoped that the worst case is a "worst case of a worst 
  case" and rarely happens on the real network.
  To determine how often it happens, the next build will ship additions
  to the statistics page to monitor it [2].
  If it happens to often, there is still hope: During the months of
  development of the new code, quite a few ideas for further improvement
  arose. Part of those are completely new algorithms, and thus they're 
  not implemented yet but will have to wait until we have measurements 
  to show whether the effort of rewriting this yet once more is 
  indicated.

- The improved startup time of ~2 minutes is still too much.
  It is caused by the fact that WoT will currently subscribe to the USKs 
  of *all* trusted Identities - currently over 11 000!
  This is not only inacceptable from a startup point of view, but also 
  from a network-load perspective - it causes a O(N^2) network-wide 
  load; and also slows down each individual node significantly.
  Hence, the algorithm will be changed to only subscribe to the USKs of 
  directly trusted identities; and to fetch non-directly-trusted ones in 
  a more sparse, opportunistic approach. See [3].

- The new incremental distrust computation code was the subject of my 
  bachelor's thesis. It therefore yielded not only the new algorithm, 
  but also a very long document which describes the old algorithm and 
  the steps towards the new one.
  This thesis' document has turned out to be well-suited to become a 
  "WoT developer's manual", and I plan to release it as such soon.
  I will wait with that until university has graded it (ETA: October) 
  for slightly selfish reasons: I don't want to risk getting negative 
  opinions on it before I know for sure that I passed - that'd only 
  cause needless panic. I hope this is only slightly selfish as a  
  non-paniced xor is a happy xor and a happy xor will produce more
  WoT code :)
  I will announce the document on the usual channels once it is 
  available.
